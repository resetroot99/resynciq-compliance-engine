# ComplianceIQ Core Principles

## **How ComplianceIQ is Unique**
Unlike existing solutions like **CCC ONE or Mitchell**, ComplianceIQ doesn't just **flag errors**‚Äîit **proactively fixes them**. The **Predictive Approval Modeling** feature helps shops **pre-screen estimates before submission**, reducing rejections. The **Multi-Insurer Compliance Engine** dynamically adjusts estimates based on **each insurer's specific rules**, ensuring first-time approvals. With **AI-powered auto-corrections, compliance enforcement, and approval forecasting**, ComplianceIQ **eliminates manual rework**, saving insurers and repair shops **time and money**.
