# 🚗 ReSyncIQ Compliance Engine

## 🌟 Revolutionizing DRP Program Management with AI

### 📚 About the DRP Program and ARX

![DRP Program](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resetroot99/resynciq-compliance-engine/main/public/images/drp-program.png)

The Direct Repair Program (DRP) is a network of collision repair shops that work directly with insurance companies to streamline the claims process. ARX (Automated Repair eXchange) is a critical component of modern DRP programs, enabling:

- 🔄 Real-time data exchange between shops and insurers
- 🤖 Automated compliance checks
- ⚡ Streamlined estimate approvals
- 🎯 Enhanced quality control

# ComplianceIQ

## Overview
ComplianceIQ is an **AI-powered insurance estimate review platform** that automates and streamlines the process of reviewing and validating collision repair estimates. Unlike existing solutions like CCC ONE or Mitchell, ComplianceIQ doesn't just **flag errors**—it **proactively fixes them** using **AI-powered auto-corrections, compliance enforcement, and approval forecasting**.

---

## **System Overview**
This project revolutionizes insurance estimate review and compliance by integrating AI-driven automation with CCC ONE APIs. Our web-based Reviewer Dashboard offers automated corrections, real-time recommendations, and predictive approval insights, significantly reducing manual effort and improving accuracy.

### **Key Features**
✅ **AI-Powered Estimate Review** – Automatically detects errors and suggests corrections.  
✅ **Auto-Correction & Compliance** – Ensures insurer and OEM compliance before submission.  
✅ **Predictive Approval Modeling** – Uses AI to forecast approval likelihood based on past data.  
✅ **Real-Time Recommendations** – Displays tailored suggestions directly in the dashboard.  
✅ **Seamless CCC ONE Integration** – Uses CCC APIs to pull, correct, and update estimates.  

---

## **Core Principles**
1️⃣ **Proactive, Not Reactive** – AI doesn't just flag issues; it **auto-corrects them for approval**.  
2️⃣ **Insurer-Specific Customization** – The system must **adapt to different insurer rules dynamically**.  
3️⃣ **First-Time Right** – The goal is to **reduce rejections & resubmissions** with **predictive approval modeling**.  
4️⃣ **Seamless Automation** – Minimize human effort by making **AI-driven auto-corrections intuitive**.  
5️⃣ **User-Centric** – The interface must be **clear, professional, and frictionless for adjusters & repair shops**.  

---

## **Getting Started**
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
